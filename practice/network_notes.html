<h1>Network Notes</h1>
<h2>Vocabularly</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Protocol</dt>
<dd>A set of rules that governs how traffic flows in a network.</dd>
<dt>Packet</dt>
<dd>Small segments of data that larger chunks of data are split up into.</dd>
<dt>Header</dt>
<dd>Meta data attached to a packet that contains information such as the packets origin, destination, and which # of packets.</dd>
<dt>Payload</dt>
<dd>The actual data contained in a packet, the content of the message.</dd>
<dt>Router</dt>
<dd>Special kind of computer that routes packets.</dd>
<dt>Routing Table</dt>
<dd>Data table that contains routes to network destinations.</dd>
</dl>
<h2>Problems That Occur on a Packet Switched Network</h2>
<ul>
<li>Lost Packets
<ul><li>Packets can get lost for a variety of reasons.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Overloaded Computers
<ul><li>Sometimes, a computer can get overloaded with packets, at which point it usually shuts down and loses all of the packets it had at the time.</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Changing Network Structure
<ul><li>The structure of the internet is constantly changing for a variety of reasons, from power outages to new computers coming online.</li></ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Protocols We Came Up With in Class</h2>
<dl>
<dt>Packet Headers</dt>
<dd>Adding a header to packets specifying which # packet it was, which address sent it, and where it was going to.<br>
This helps by telling the recipient how to put the packets together, and it helps the computers on the network that it goes through get the packets where they need to go.</dd>
<dt>Who are you?</dt>
<dd>Asking neighbors for IP address, helps map the network.</dd>
<dt>Request Network Information</dt>
<dd>Asking your neighbors for who their neighbors are, helps the sender send the packet in the right direction.</dd>
</dl>
