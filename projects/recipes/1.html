	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p>I've always loved brownies, and, as such I learned to make them myself. It is significant to me and my family because we have made a tradition of making brownies every other week. Over the years, I've learned a very good brownie recipe and tips to make it work well, and as such I wanted to share my insights. According to my mom, they are <q>The best brownies I've ever tasted!</q>.</p>
	<h3><u>Tips and Tricks</u></h3>
	<ul>
		<li>The timing is not exact: It varies oven by oven, so make sure to test the brownies with your knife a couple minutes before the given time.</li>
		<li>Take the brownies out when you can stick a knife into the brownies and take it out with only a little bit of brownie sticking to the blade</li></ul>
